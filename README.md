ðŸŸ¨ #JavaScript â€“ My Personal Learning Journal
A dedicated journal documenting my daily progress in learning JavaScript, with a focus on building consistency, mastering fundamentals, and understanding how the language works behind the scenes. ðŸš€

So far, I have explored and practiced the following concepts:

âœ… Data Types & Type Conversion â€“ including primitive vs reference types, implicit & explicit conversion

âœ… Memory Management â€“ understanding Stack vs Heap in JS

âœ… Numbers & Math Operations â€“ built-in methods, rounding, parsing, etc.

âœ… Arrays & Objects â€“ creation, manipulation, and iteration patterns

âœ… Functions in Depth â€“ declaration, expression, arrow functions, and hoisting

âœ… Scope & Closures â€“ block/function/global scope, lexical scope, closures

âœ… The this Keyword â€“ and how it behaves in different contexts

âœ… Control Flow â€“ if-else, switch, ternary

âœ… Loops â€“ for, while, do-while, for...of, for...in, forEach()

âœ… Higher Order Array Methods â€“ deep practice with map(), filter(), reduce(), find(), some(), and every()

âœ… Callbacks & Arrow Functions â€“ writing clean and reusable code

Iâ€™m now moving ahead to cover asynchronous JavaScript â€” including Promises, async/await, and working with APIs and fetch â€” followed by DOM manipulation and building real mini-projects to reinforce everything.

This journey is all about consistency, building a strong JS foundation, and preparing to use JavaScript confidently in real-world projects and frameworks like React.
